# Casual C Code Reviewers

This group was set up for us to read, review and learn to code. Our group is inspired by the talk [Lets review code together](https://media.ccc.de/v/rc3-2021-cwtv-228-lets-review-code-toget) by [khaleesicodes](https://github.com/khaleesicodes) and [stoeckmann](https://github.com/stoeckmann).

We usually meet on Wednesday 19:00 CE(S)T in our Jitsi room.

The group is comprised of both beginners and experts. Our goals are to learn more about C, review programs and find bugs. Everybody is welcome to join.

You are interested, have questions or want to join us? Lets talk in our [discussions](https://github.com/CasualCCodeReviewers/about/discussions) section!
