# Casual C Code Reviewers

We founded us to to read, review and learn code. Our group is inspired by the talk [Lets review code together](https://media.ccc.de/v/rc3-2021-cwtv-228-lets-review-code-toget) by [khaleesicodes](https://github.com/khaleesicodes) and [stoeckmann](https://github.com/stoeckmann).

We usually meet on Wednesday 19:00 CE(S)T in our Jitsi room.

In the group are both experts and beginners and everbody is welcome. Our goals are to learn more about C, review programs and find bugs.

You are intrested, have questions or want join us? Lets talk in our [discussions](https://github.com/CasualCCodeReviewers/about/discussions)!
